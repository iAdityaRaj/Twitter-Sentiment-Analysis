# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a technique used in text mining. It may, therefore, be described as a text mining technique for analyzing the underlying sentiment of a text message, i.e., a tweet. Twitter sentiment or opinion expressed through it may be positive, negative or neutral. However, no algorithm can give you 100% accuracy or prediction on sentiment analysis.
<p>
We used Python, Tweepy and TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis of a selected twitter account using  twitter API and Natural Processing Language. 
<br> Importing  Python Modules:
<br>textblob ,
<br>sys ,
<br>tweepy ,
<br>matplotlib.pyplot ,
<br>pandas ,
<br>numpy ,
<br>PIL ,
<br>wordcloud ,
<br>re ,
